When it goes I feel the crush
When I rush it hits me
Take the key and spin it 'round
Hang the carpet where it was

There's a level to be reached
There's a chance to make it right
There's a heart inside that beats
Kick the dog and you will die

I can see through the word
And it's not written
There's a chance and there's a start
I can see through the word
And it's not written
There's a chance and there's a start

Do I wait to see it right
Are you conscious overall
If the overture's alright
Should I go or should I say

What should I say

Will I wait to see it right
Are you conscious overall
If the overtures are right
There's a line about to fall

I can see through the word
And it's not written
There's a chance and there's a start

Take a chance to paralyze
The whole process slowly wild
Hanging on take the fun away
Take the keys and move my car
These are ideas they are not lies
Kick the dog and you will die
I can see through the word
And it's not written
