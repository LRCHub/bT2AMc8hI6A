You know you really were the bomb
Oh, oh, oh, atomic infamy
You really have to display information
To discover relativity

You know you really were the bomb
Oh, oh, oh, atomic infamy
You really have to display information
To discover relativity
You're no faker, love and peace maker
Come and take a moment with your enemy

Aha oh, don't speak cause your mind is amazing
Aha Aha
Aha oh, don't speak cause your mind is amazing
Aha Aha

And on the atoll of desire
Oh, oh, oh, battle was fought and won
Who took advantage and who was defenseless?
Oh, no, peppermint girl's not done
Remember this emotional equation
Don't test the moment when you break the sun

Aha oh, don't speak cause your mind is amazing
Aha Aha
Aha oh, don't speak cause your mind is amazing
Aha Aha

Dancing you're tearing it up you know
Dancing you're tearing it up you know
Dancing you're tearing it up you know
Dancing you're tearing it up you know

Don't speak cause your mind is amazing
Dancing you're tearing it up you know
Dancing you're tearing it up...

Don't speak cause your mind is amazing
